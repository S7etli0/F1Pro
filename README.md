#Formula 1 Python Project

https://www.formula1.com/ is the official site of the international open wheel racing sport, where
you can find statistical information about each year the competition has been held.

The task is to create an app that extracts data from https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html and
arranges the information in the following categories:
- calendar : country, date, laps, duration
- race wins : country, first_name, last_name, nickname, team_name
- driver ranks : first_name, last_name, nationality, team_name, points
- team ranks : team name, drivers, points

Use the PyQt5 interface to present the data in table format and include the following options:
- save the data in a MySQL table
- load and erase the saved MySQL tables
- rearrange the data

There are no limitations for using data from https://www.formula1.com/
